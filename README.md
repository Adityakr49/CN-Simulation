# Network Simulation for Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ Protocol

## Overview

This repository contains network simulation code for the Go-Back-N (GBN) and Selective Repeat (SR) Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols using TCL scripts and NS2 (Network Simulator 2). The simulations allow for the analysis and comparison of these two ARQ protocols in a simulated network environment.

## Introduction

Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols are essential for reliable data transmission over unreliable communication channels. The Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat are two commonly used ARQ protocols, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. This repository provides simulation scripts to study and analyze the performance of these protocols in a simulated network environment.
